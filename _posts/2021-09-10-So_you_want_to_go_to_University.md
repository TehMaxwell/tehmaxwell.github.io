title: So you want to go to University? (10/09/2021)
---

Should I go to University? It's a question that more and more people are starting to genuinely ask themselves. With most prospective students having to borrow large sums of money to cover rising
University fees and living costs, for many it's starting to become a difficult question to answer. In this blog post, I'm aiming to share my experience in order to provide some insight on what
University is like and whether it might be worth it for you. A point of reference if you will. I'll try to weigh up the pros and cons as best I can to aide in making an informed decision.

Before we get started, it's worthwile making note of a few important points:

- I'm writing this in September 2021, having finished my degree in July 2021. Thus, at the time of writing my perspective is relatively fresh and my experience relatively recent. That being said, if
you are reading this in a few years time then circumstances may have changed.
- I can only provide reference for one University (The University of Sheffield) and one course (Electronic and Electrical Engineering). Although there are many parallels between Universities and courses,
each is also different in it's own right. Remember to take what's written here with a pinch of salt and try to translate it to your own circumstances.

With the above things in mind, lets get cracking!

### What does University bring me?

This is arguably the biggest question, so we shall tackle it first. What do you actually get from going to University? Here's a list of the major take aways that I had:

- A degree (apologies as this seems obvious, but worth mentioning nonetheless). Depending on the duration of your course this could be at Batchelors or Masters level, generally speaking they are 3 or 4 years
respectively (with an additional year in Scotland in most cases).
