title: A Visit to the World Expo (14/02/2022)
---

Once again, it has been a long time since I last posted. Life has again changed a lot since we last spoke. There is lots to catch up on (I've done some very exciting things), but I'm going to focus on one major event I recently had the privledge to attend. In the January of this year I was fortunate enough to visit the 2020 World Expo in Dubai. World Expos aim to showcase and share the Culture, Technology, History and Personality of countries from across the globe. This post will cover my highlights from the Expo and talk through my key takeaways from Technology, Sustainability and Political angles; I may even sneak in some information
about other things to see in Dubai too. Lets get cracking!

#### Slow down Sam! Can you explain what the 2020 World Expo is first?

Pardon me, absolutely. Expo 2020 is the latest World Expo running from October 2021 to the end of March 2022 in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. You can imagine the site as once of the largest museums/exhibition centers you have ever seen. Comprising of 192 Country Pavillions, 5 Central Pavillions and a host of other themed Pavillions; the Expo 2020 site covers 4.4km<sup>2</sup> of what was desert only 5 years previously (see images below). The logistical challenge alone to build a site of this scale, variation and complexity in such a short space of time is mind boggling.

Inside each pavillion the host aims to showcase their technology, history and culture. This can take many forms, from artwork to artificial intelligence. Many pavillions also aim to focus on one of three major themes covered at Expo 2020 Dubai: Mobility, Sustainability and Opportunity. A brief outline of these themes is as follows:

* **Mobility** - Developments surrounding technological and social mobility. This can come in many forms including data mobility, public and private transport, open education and technology for equity among many others.
* **Sustainability** - Developments surrounding sustainable causes. For example: renewable energies, sustainabile architecture, energy monitoring, sustainable policy and sustainability education to name a few.
* **Opportunity** - Stories, technologies, information and inspiration surrounding the United Nations (UN) Sustainabile Development Goals (SDGs).
