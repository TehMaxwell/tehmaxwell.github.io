title: A Virtual World and the Factory of the Future (26/11/2020)
---

Since we last spoke there have been a number of developments surrounding the Coronavirus. We have transitioned from the first wave to the second, unemployment levels are high and rising, businesses are shutting and families are apart. Good news has arrived though with the advent of posiive vaccine trial results. I hope that soon things will return to a version of normality and that 2021 will be a different story.

<br/>

I write about this in particular because I've been thinking about the lasting effect the pandemic will have, particularly in the engineering and industrial sector. There is no doubt that the working day will be drastically changed as a result of this, even after we have come out the other side of the pandemic. Many organizations have already announced that they intend to primarily move to a remote working structure ([Twitter Remote Working](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52628119 "Twitter"), Google, Amazon and Siemens to name a few). There are a number of benefits this provides:

- Better work-life balance for employees because of a (significantly) reduced commute. This also reduces travel costs for a lot of people.
- A reduced carbon footprint for companies as less employees will travel to work each day. (A massive benefit in the fight against climate change).
- Cost savings on leasing offices, particularly prevalent in expensive cities.
- Flexibility of working location. If your working remotely you don't have to be at home. As long as you have an internet connection and a laptop, you can do your work from anywhere.

The items listed above are very compelling for both employees and companies. Although slightly cliche, it is true to say that the world is getting smaller. Modern technology allows us to communicate with each other anytime, anywhere, with the click of a button. An abundance of information is instantly available, allowing people to solve problems and learn new skills more quickly than ever before. **In many ways, I am surprised it has taken this long to move to more heavy remote working policies.** Although our virtual working technology has been sometimes stretched during the pandemic, the overriding conclusion is that many things can be just as efficiently (if not more efficiently) completed remotely.

But. And this may come as a surprise from someone of my generation of digital natives. Let me play devils advocate for a second and talk about some of the challenges this may pose. It's important to note that although some of these points focus on the engineering sector they will probably apply in other areas. Here goes:

Some jobs can't be completed remotely
Remote support for technical problems, the speed of that support
Remote monitoring and control of factory infrastructure
Social and self fulfillment aspects (will people get lonely?)
The positive impact of your environment
Creative ideas and design. Some of the best work is spontaneous and evolving (a chance meeting in a corridor, a conversation over lunch)
