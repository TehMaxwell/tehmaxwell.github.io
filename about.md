### What's this blog about?

I'm Sam, a budding Electrical and Electronic Engineer currently in the 3rd Year of my degree at the University of Sheffield. I'm interested in just about anything to do with technology, but you'll regularly find me discussing one of the following topics:

- Electronics (shock horror!)
- Programming (mostly Python, C, C++, C#, Arduino and sometimes Verilog)
- Model Aircraft and Multirotors (During my downtime I build and fly planes and multirotors with First Person View (FPV) systems onboard)
- 3D Printing
- General Life Experiences

This blog is all about my haphazard and somewhat sporadic journey through the world of engineering. My aim is to share my mistakes so that you can learn from them too! It's going to be an interesting journey and I appreciate anyone following me through it. Enjoy!

### What else is here?

As well as finding my (somewhat irregular) blog posts, you can also find links to different projects, documents and software I have created throughout my journey.
These items can be found in the reports section of the website, you can navigate to this at the top of the page. If it's posted on here you are free to download it and use it as you please!

### Who are you?

As it says above, I'm currently an Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at the University of Sheffield in the 3rd Year of my degree. I am on an integrated masters program (MEng), so I have one more year to go before I graduate. As well as this, I'm involved in a few other things:

- I'm currently a member of the Sheffield Engineering Leadership Academy (SELA) at the University of Sheffield. This is a program for undergraduate engineers aimed at developing leadership and other soft skills. You can find more about SELA here: <https://sela-sheffield.org/>
- I am fortunate to have received an Engineering Leadership Scholarship from the Royal Academy of Engineers, you can find more about that here: <https://www.raeng.org.uk/grants-prizes/grants/schemes-for-students/engineering-leaders-scholarship>
- I am currently a representative for the IForge at the University of Sheffield, the UK's first Student led Makerspace! More information here: <https://iforgesheffield.org/>
- I am also a member of the Siemens Digital Academy. This program aims to educate undergraduate engineers on new digital technologies, ready for when they enter industry. More information here: <https://new.siemens.com/uk/en/company/jobs/life-at-siemens/digitalacademy.html>
