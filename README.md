# Sam Maxwells Blog - Tales of a Rookie

This repository hosts my blog, Tales of a Rookie. Here you can find all of the files used to host the site, as well as all of the markdown files that
generate the blog posts. The site is built using Jekyll, the static website building program.

## Running the Site Locally

In order to run and edit the site locally you must have the following items installed:

- Ruby
- Ruby Gem Support
- Jekyll

More information on the requirements for these packages can be found in the Jekyll installation guide: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
Once you have installed these requirements you can use the following command in a console operating in the root directory to build and host the site locally:

'''
jekyll serve
'''
